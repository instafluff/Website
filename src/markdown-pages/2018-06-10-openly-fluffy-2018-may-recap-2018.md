Openly Fluffy May 2018 Recap

Hello to a new month, everyone!

This month will mark a whole year of streams, can you believe it? What an amazing journey it has been so far, and it is thanks to the support from all of the wonderful people in our community just like you. So before we get into the recap notes, I would like to invite all of you to come and celebrate together at the end of this month on Friday the 29th the experiences we've had and the memories we've made over the past year. Hope you will be able to join us.

#### Fluff Thoughts ####

Through the month of May, we experimented with sticking to the same games and instead spent more time with puns, great lies to tell kids, silly test answers, and even fancy manners and business etiquette and I think it felt right for us. So that is what I think we should continue to focus on with more stories, pancakes, music, more... fluffy! While I am afraid that moving away from primarily games might lose the interest of some of our regulars, this is the direction I would like for us to keep moving towards: less game, more us. I hope you think so too.

We have a new, HEART emote! (Thanks, PinataHero!) Do you like it? It also means our lurk emote, instafLurk, is now open to everyone via FFZ/BTTV so if you would like to say hi but don't quite feel chatty, this emote is available now for you. At the same time, this month, we merged all of our roles in Discord together because it kept bothering me a bit that it would show subscribers separate from everyone else when from the beginning our community has been about welcoming everyone. I hope these changes agreed with you too.

I have also been thinking about how to be more active off-stream and even though we have a Discord server, it doesn't feel as welcoming as I would like it to feel. While I don't have any concrete plans yet, this is an area where it seems like I could work on and help encourage more of us to get to know each other.

There are some more fluffnouncements but those will be a surprise during our streamaversary stream!

#### Plans ####

More fluff... what's that mean?

Well, we defeated the Fluff Boss yet again last month and so as promised, we will have a Gears of War marathon bonus stream in the next few weeks with PinataHero and I. But we would like to take it further! This month, we will introduce more Pinata-Fluff streams, playing with integrating Pinata's stream ideas.

Save the Date: Friday, June 29th. That's the day we will celebrate our Comfy Corner community together in our first ever Fluff Year's Eve Celebration. We have some fun things planned and even more funnouncements to share in what our little community's future looks like!

#### Asks ####

Some folks might remember when we talked about our stream and community now almost a year ago and how great it would be if by the time we reach our streamaversary that we would be a very different stream while our insta-comfy mission and philosophy remained true. So what do you think? I think we are pretty different from when we began. Also do you feel like we have stuck to our vision of making it an instantly-fluffy stream for everyone? If you could take a moment to share some feedback with me, it would be greatly appreciated!

#### Summary ####

* One whole year?! Streamaversary Friday, Jun 29th. Come celebrate with us!
* Fluffier streams... Less game, More us.
* Gears of War Marathon Bonus Stream very soon. TBA.
* Do you feel like we have stuck to our vision of making it an instantly-fluffy stream for everyone?

Thank you for your support in helping us make it through a whole year of streams! I am very excited to reveal more about our first ever Fluff Year's Eve Celebration in the coming weeks and feel so ever grateful to have met you.

Stay Comfy,

***Instafluff***
